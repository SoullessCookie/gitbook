# Exercise 1 - Working with Windows Administrative Tools



### **Exercise 1 - Working with Windows Administrative Tools** <a href="#cn-m5-60" id="cn-m5-60"></a>

Administrative tools are a collection of computer management services that help to perform regular maintenance tasks, such as disk defragmentation, disk clean-up, and running system memory diagnostics. These tools also help manage the system by defining the security policy for Windows and other devices running on the system. Administrative tools are available on the **Start** screen or even as a part of the **Control Panel**.



#### **Task 1 - Access Computer Management Tools** <a href="#cn-m5-78" id="cn-m5-78"></a>

Computer management services enable you to manage system tools, storage, services, and applications of your local or remote system. Moreover, by using these tools you can automate some of the routine system management tasks. **Computer Management** tools are available as a part of the **Administrative tools**.

In this task, you will access the **Computer Management** tools.

_**Step 1**_

Ensure **PLABWIN10** is powered on and connected.

The desktop is displayed.

In the **Type here to search** textbox in the taskbar, type the following:

```
Administrative Tools  
```

Under **Best Match** section, select **Administrative Tools**.

#### **Task 2 - Configure Local Security Policy** <a href="#cn-m5-108" id="cn-m5-108"></a>

Local security policy configures the security settings of your local machine; thereby allowing you to make your device more secure, taking care of possible threats. For example, by using these policies you can configure the system firewall, set application and software control policies, enforce passwords, specify trusted domains, configure access rights, define account privileges, and schedule security auditing.

These settings can be broadly categorized into three types - user-related settings, system-related settings, and security-related settings.

In this task, you will modify the password settings on the system.

_**Step 1**_

Ensure that the **Administrative Tools** window is displayed.

On the **Administrative Tools** window, double-click **Local Security Policy**.

<figure><img src="https://www.practice-labs.com/authenticated/images/220-1002/image-m5-c-6.jpg?v=29" alt="Figure 1.5 Screenshot of PLABWIN10: Double-clicking Local Security Policy."><figcaption><p>Figure 1.5 Screenshot of PLABWIN10: Double-clicking Local Security Policy.</p></figcaption></figure>

#### **Task 8 - Access the Event Viewer Logs** <a href="#cn-m5-353" id="cn-m5-353"></a>

The **Event Viewer** is a system tool in Windows which displays information about various events happening on your computer. This tool can help to track the event flow while troubleshooting any issues either with the OS or the installed applications. The **Event Log** service starts as soon as you start Windows.

There are three types of event logs: application logs, system logs, and security logs. Application and System logs are available to all users; however, security logs are available only to the administrators.

In this task, you will access application logs on the system.

_**Step 1**_

Ensure that the **Administrative Tools** window is displayed.

Double-click **Event Viewer**.

_**Step 2**_

The **Event Viewer** console is displayed.

In the left pane, expand the **Windows Logs** node, and then select the **Application** log.

_**Step 3**_

Notice that various events relevant to the applications on the system are listed in the middle pane. You can have events that are labeled as Information, Warning, and Error.

_**Note:** If the events have not loaded, you may need to maximize the Event Viewer window and click on Windows Logs on the left side of the window and then back onto the Application section._

_**Step 4**_

You can have events that are labeled as Information, Warning, Error and so on. Click **System** in the left pane. Notice that there are different types of events listed.

_**Note:** In your lab environment, there may be a possibility that all of these may not be listed._

_**Step 5**_

The **Event Viewer** console is displayed. Notice that the Windows Logs node displays different types of logs. It is important to note that these are static logs on all Windows systems. However, a server with specific services, such as a DNS server, can have DNS logs as well. Such logs are listed under the Applications and Services Logs node.

Expand **Applications and Services Logs**. Notice that these logs are specific to applications.

Close all open windows.
